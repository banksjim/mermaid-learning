# Mermaid Sequence Diagram Examples

## Basic sequence diagram example

```mermaid
  sequenceDiagram
  Alice ->> John: Hello John, how are you?
  John -->> Alice: Great!
  Alice -) John: Awesome. See you later!  
```

> **Note:** The word "end" could potentially break the diagram, due to the way that the mermaid language is scripted. If unavoidable, one must use parentheses(), quotation marks "", or brackets {},[], to enclose it.

## Syntax

### Participants

The participants can be defined implicitly as in the first example on this page. The participants or actors are rendered in order of appearance in the diagram source text. Sometimes you might want to show the participants in a different order than how they appear in the first message. It is possible to specify the actor's order of appearance by doing the following:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant Alice
  participant Bob
  
  Alice ->> Bob: Hi Bob
  Bob ->> Alice: Hi Alice
```

### Actors

If you specifically want to use the actor symbol instead of a rectangle with text you can do so by using actor statements as per below.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  actor Alice
  actor Bob
  
  Alice ->> Bob: Hi Bob
  Bob ->> Alice: Hi Alice
```

### Aliases

The actor can be assigned to a reference variable.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant A as Alice
  participant J as John

  A ->> J: Hello John, how are you?
  J ->> A: I'm fine Alice  
```
